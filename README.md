# final_project
this is our final project, for Ian and McCall. our project will be a magic 8 ball. 
Our group is Ian and McCall. Our group name is team Magic 8 ball.
Our project idea is to create a magic 8 ball application. 
We would like to simply make a magic 8 ball that at random gives back advice and or answers. 
JavaScript, html, and css will all be used. JS will be the key because it gives it functionality. 
User Stories: User- I want the ball to give back number answers to my question. 
Employees: We will use Math.random to allow random numbers to pop up on the ball when a question is rendered. 
User: We want the 8 ball to have a clean look aliong with a well spaced out webpage (holy grail). 
Employee: Use CSS to structure and style the whole page neatly.
