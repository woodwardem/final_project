Our project idea is to create a magic 8 ball application.

JavaScript, html, and css will all be used. JS will be the key because it gives it functionality. 
User Stories: User- I want the ball to give back number answers to my question. 
Employees: We will use Math.random to allow random numbers to pop up on the ball when a question is rendered.
